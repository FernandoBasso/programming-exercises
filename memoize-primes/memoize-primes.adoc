= Memoizing Primes

Create a function that receives a number and checks whether it is a prime
number or not. You must use _memoization_ for that, though.

Every time the function is called, you check in some form of “local cache” if
that number has been checked before. If it has, just returns true/false
according to its primeness. Otherwise, check if it is prime, store the result
in the cache, and return the result.
