= Iterator

Create an “iterator”. It is a function that you call passing it an array.
It returns a function which in turn, each time is called, return one of
the elements of the array, starting with the first, until all elements
have been returned, in which case it just returns false from that point on.


Example of its input and output.

[source,javascript,lineos]
----
var it = iterator('a b c'.split(' '));
it();   // →  a
it();   // →  b
it();   // →  c
it();   // →  false
it();   // →  false, always false from now on.
