= Palindrome

Given a string or characters, return true or false depending whether the
string is a palindrome or not. The algorithm is free to consider uppercase
letters or not, that is, ‘ana’ is a palindrome, but depending on your
algorithm's implementation ‘Ana’ may or may not be considered a palindrome.


Thinking recursively, we can say that:
1. A single or zero-character string is a palindrome.
2. Any other string is a palindrome if the first and last characters are the
   same and the string that remains (excepting those characters) is a palindrome.
